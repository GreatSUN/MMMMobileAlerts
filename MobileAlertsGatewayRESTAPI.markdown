# Mobile Alerts REST API

Recently Mobile Alerts documented their REST API, which allows accessing the last value in the cloud. It is only available for few sensors (ID 01, 08, 09, 0B and 0E) sensor types.

A description and download of the REST API can be found [here](https://mobile-alerts.eu/info/public_server_api_documentation.pdf).
